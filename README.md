# notion-cms-boilerplate project

## Getting started

This project combines the power of Notion as a CMS with modern web development tools like Next.js, providing a flexible foundation for your content management needs.

This guide will walk you through the setup process and essential features of this boilerplate.

### Why?

I love Notion and imho it’s a great (and free) tool that can work as a CMS.

There are some cool projects (e.g. [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x)) that can be used for the same purpose, but I wanted to base my solution on an official Notion tools. 

I had tons of fun playing with their API to render components and show everything I needed to create my personal website, so I’ve decided to make this project open-source. 

I hope it can be helpful to someone.

### Demo

You can check the demo [here](https://notion-cms-boilerplate.vercel.app/).

### TLDR

To implement this project, you would need to duplicate [Notion database](https://tinyurl.com/mpearp29) to your workspace, create a new [Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) to get an API key, clone the [notion-cms-boilerplate repository](https://github.com/WojtekTheWebDev/notion-cms-boilerplate), configure the environment variables with your Notion credentials, and deploy the Next.js application to your preferred hosting platform.

### Database

First, you need to duplicate the project’s Notion database - available [here](https://www.notion.so/CMS-19eabb8900388044bae4c08a4d020786?pvs=21).

It contains the list of pages that would be rendered in your project. After cloning it, you should see **Getting started** page. Don’t remove it yet, it would be helpful to ensure that everything in the setup has been done correctly.

Once you’ve duplicated the database, save it’s ID - it would be necessary in project setup. You can check it in the Notion url -[`https://www.notion.so/<DB_NAME>-<DB_ID>`](https://www.notion.so/CMS-19eabb8900388044bae4c08a4d020786?pvs=21)

Each item in the database is a page that contains properties and content.

The properties are:

- Slug
- Meta title
- Meta description
- SEO Keywords

A slug would be necessary to render your page. Home page uses `home` by default.

After creating a new page, simply navigate to `<yourdomain>.<extension>/<slug>` or [`localhost:300/<slug>`](http://localhost:300/<slug>) for local development.

### Notion integration

To fetch the data, it’s necessary to create a Notion integration. It can be an internal integration. Follow the [guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#getting-started) to create one. Save your **Internal Integration Secret**, it would be necessary in project setup.

After creating an integration, give the permissions (as the [guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions) explains) to the duplicated database in your Notion space.

### Project

To start, simply use this [template](https://github.com/WojtekTheWebDev/notion-cms-boilerplate) to create a new GitHub repository and clone it.

Then, copy the *.env.example* and rename it to *.env*. Use your **Internal Integration Secret** and **Database ID** (from previous steps) as `NOTION_SECRET` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`.

It’s all. 

You can run `npm run dev`. 

If everything went properly, you should see this **Getting started** page. 

Now, feel free to remove it, edit the content and do whatever you want.

### Deployment

The whole project is based on a Next.js app. The easiest way to deploy it is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## How-tos

### Setting Up Image Ratio

In this project, images are displayed with a specific width and height to maintain a consistent aspect ratio. This is necessary because Next.js requires both width and height to properly optimize and render images.

The default width and height are defined in the `constants.ts` file:

```typescript
export const defaultWidth = 500;
export const ratio = 16 / 9;
export const defaultHeight = defaultWidth / ratio;
```

You can adjust the `defaultWidth` and `ratio` values to change the dimensions of the images. The `defaultHeight` is automatically calculated based on the width and ratio.

For example, if you want to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, you can update the `ratio` value:

```diff
- export const ratio = 16 / 9;
+ export const ratio = 4 / 3;
```

This will ensure that all images maintain the new aspect ratio while being rendered.
